# MemLoadProgram
This is a proof of concept for loading shared object directly from memory without accessing the actual Linux file system.

This project can only run on Linux, because it uses `memfd_create` which is not portable.

# Build
Use `make` to build this project, `make clean` cleanup artifact generated by build system.

# TODO
- Decrypt .so in runtime to further proof the necessity of loading program directly from memory.
- Auto-encrypt shared object in build system.
